title: The "Puff" progression (pop/rock harmony)
---

{{ page.title }}
================

**I – III – IV . . .** (to begin a phrase)

The “puff” progression is named after “Puff, the Magic dragon” by Peter, Paul, and Mary, a song that begins with this progression. It does not participate in 3- or 4-chord cycles like the above progressions. However, it is typically bound to the opening of phrases, and typically harmonizes the bass mi/me as III, rather than a first-inversion I. “House of the Rising Sun” by the Animals is an example of this progression beginning phrases in minor (*do*–*me*–*fa* . . .).
